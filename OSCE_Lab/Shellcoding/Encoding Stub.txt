____Shellcode Encoding ASM:____

MOV EAX, Addr		      	; Save shellcode first address in EAX
XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],0E  	; XOR the contents of EAX with a key 0E
INC EAX                   	; Increase EAX
CMP EAX, [Addr after last addr of shellcode]	; Have we reached the last shellcode address?
JLE SHORT [XOR Addr]		; If not, jump back to XOR command
JMP [Shellcode Addr]           	; We are done! let's execute the shellcode


NOTE: We could also use push [reg] the pop [reg] within the stub.
